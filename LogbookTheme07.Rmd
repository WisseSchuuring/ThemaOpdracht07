week 1:

searched the website

found old dataset

looked at old dataset and associated article

determined core research


week 2:

Explored files in dataset

created Project Proposal

Began EDA and sorted files into single large file


Upon recieving the data, the samples were split up into six seperated tsv files. first, I had to reformat them into csv. Next, I had to add a column to every csv file, to show which sample it belonged to. Next, I had to place all sample data in a single file. 

```{r}
# rawdata <- read.csv(file = 'Data/Samples/GSM3733674_sample1.csv', sep = ';', header=T)
# rawdata$SAMPLE <- 1
# write.csv(rawdata,file = 'Data/Samples/Reformat/sample1.csv', row.names=F, col.names=F)
# 
# rawdata2 <- read.csv(file = 'Data/Samples/GSM3733675_sample2.csv', sep = ';', header=T)
# rawdata2$SAMPLE <- 2
# write.csv(rawdata2,file = 'Data/Samples/Reformat/sample2.csv', row.names=F, col.names=F)
# 
# rawdata3 <- read.csv(file = 'Data/Samples/GSM3733676_sample3.csv', sep = ';', header=T)
# rawdata3$SAMPLE <- 3
# write.csv(rawdata3,file = 'Data/Samples/Reformat/sample3.csv', row.names=F, col.names=F)
# 
# rawdata4 <- read.csv(file = 'Data/Samples/GSM3733677_sample4.csv', sep = ';', header=T)
# rawdata4$SAMPLE <- 4
# write.csv(rawdata4,file = 'Data/Samples/Reformat/sample4.csv', row.names=F, col.names=F)
# 
# rawdata5 <- read.csv(file = 'Data/Samples/GSM3733678_sample5.csv', sep = ';', header=T)
# rawdata5$SAMPLE <- 5
# write.csv(rawdata5,file = 'Data/Samples/Reformat/sample5.csv', row.names=F, col.names=F)
# 
# rawdata6 <- read.csv(file = 'Data/Samples/GSM3733679_sample6.csv', sep = ';', header=T)
# rawdata6$SAMPLE <- 6
# write.csv(rawdata6,file = 'Data/Samples/Reformat/sample6.csv', row.names=F, col.names=F)
# #
# 
# rawdata <- read.csv(file = 'Data/Samples/Reformat/sample1.csv')
# rawdata$TYPE <- "Parental"
# write.csv(rawdata,file = 'Data/Samples/Reformat/sample_1.csv', row.names=F)
# 
# rawdata2 <- read.csv(file = 'Data/Samples/Reformat/sample2.csv')
# rawdata2$TYPE <- "IRF2_KO"
# write.csv(rawdata2,file = 'Data/Samples/Reformat/sample_2.csv', row.names=F)
# 
# rawdata3 <- read.csv(file = 'Data/Samples/Reformat/sample3.csv')
# rawdata3$TYPE <- "IRF2_KO"
# write.csv(rawdata3,file = 'Data/Samples/Reformat/sample_3.csv', row.names=F)
# 
# rawdata4 <- read.csv(file = 'Data/Samples/Reformat/sample4.csv')
# rawdata4$TYPE <- "Parental"
# write.csv(rawdata4,file = 'Data/Samples/Reformat/sample_4.csv', row.names=F)
# 
# rawdata5 <- read.csv(file = 'Data/Samples/Reformat/sample5.csv')
# rawdata5$TYPE <- "Parental"
# write.csv(rawdata5,file = 'Data/Samples/Reformat/sample_5.csv', row.names=F)
# 
# rawdata6 <- read.csv(file = 'Data/Samples/Reformat/sample6.csv')
# rawdata6$TYPE <- "IRF2_KO"
# write.csv(rawdata6,file = 'Data/Samples/Reformat/sample_6.csv', row.names=F)

AllData <- read.csv(file="Data/Samples/Reformat/AllSamples.csv", header =T)
MyData <- AllData[c("ID_REF","count","SAMPLE")]
MyData

```

Here I attempted to add wether they were parental or IRF2KO, however afterwards I decided placing each in the same file, with the type noted in the column name would be more efficient.
